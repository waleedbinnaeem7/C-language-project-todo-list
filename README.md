" Create  Your  TODOs  List"

This C program allows users to manage a list of TODOs. Users can input multiple lines of tasks, and the program will write them to a file named "TODOs". 
It also provides functionality to read and display the contents of the "TODOs" file.
"TODOs" file will automatically created when you run the program.
